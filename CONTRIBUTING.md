Component: short summary of changes

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. In some contexts, the first
line is treated as the subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.
The blank line separating the summary from the body is critical.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

Resolves: #56, #78
